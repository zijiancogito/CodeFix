When pasting the code from the formatted text, it's possible that hidden characters that are not part of the actual code could be included. These characters can cause issues when compiling.

To address this issue, I have manually rewritten the code provided. You can use this retyped code to ensure there are no hidden characters causing the compilation error:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

long long foo(signed int a1, signed int a2) {
    while (a1 != a2) {
        if (a1 < a2) {
            a2 -= a1;
        } else {
            a1 -= a2;
        }
    }
    return (unsigned int)a1;
}

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    unsigned int v3;
    unsigned int v5;
    unsigned int v6;

    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "USAGE: %s <num1> <num2>\n", *argv);
        exit(1);
    }
    v5 = atoi(argv[1]);
    v6 = atoi(argv[2]);
    v3 = foo(v5, v6);
    printf("foo(%u, %u) = %u\n", v5, v6, v3);
    return 0;
}
```

Please make sure that you:
1. Copy the re-typed code above.
2. Open a plain text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or another code-friendly editor that displays raw text without formatting.
3. Paste the copied code into this editor.
4. Save the file with a '.c' extension.
5. Compile the code using your compiler.
